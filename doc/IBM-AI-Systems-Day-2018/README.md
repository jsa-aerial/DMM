The original slides with timer can be found at [../DMM-IBM-Talk-Oct2018.pdf](../DMM-IBM-Talk-Oct2018.pdf)

A more convenient archival version without timer has been hosted at https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/files/us-lmandel/aisys18-bukatin.pdf 
until the link disappeared together with all the materials of that workshop.

We have been using an archival version at the Wayback Machine at https://web.archive.org/web/20220305051310/https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/files/us-lmandel/aisys18-bukatin.pdf
until recently.

However, that archival version has also disappeared in recent weeks. 
The following link https://web.archive.org/web/20220301000000*/https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/files/us-lmandel/aisys18-bukatin.pdf
still works and points to two snapshots, but the snapshots are now defective and report "The Wayback Machine has not archived that URL".

We have been unable to get a response from Internet Archive technical support at info@archive.org so far.

So we are substituting a version hosted at this GitHub subdirectory as the canonical version.
